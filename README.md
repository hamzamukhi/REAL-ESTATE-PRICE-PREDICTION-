# REAL-ESTATE-PRICE-PREDICTION
This data science project shows process of how to build a real estate price prediction Model. I will build a model using sklearn and linear regression using Karachi home prices dataset which I have scrap data to make my own dataset.
During model building I cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter, K fold cross validation etc. 
Technology and tools wise this project covers, 
1.	Python 
2.	Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning 
3.	Matplotlib for data visualization 
4.	Sklearn for model building 
5.	Colab notebook

Scope of the project:
Prediction house prices are expected to help people who plan to buy a house so they can know the price range in the future, then they can plan their finance well. In addition, house price predictions are also beneficial for property investors to know the trend of housing prices in a certain location.
