# REAL-ESTATE-PRICE-PREDICTION
This data science project shows process of how to build a real estate price prediction Model. I will build a model using sklearn and linear regression using Karachi home prices dataset which I have scrap data to make my own dataset.
During model building I cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter, K fold cross validation etc. 
Technology and tools wise this project covers, 
1.	Python 
2.	Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning 
3.	Matplotlib for data visualization 
4.	Sklearn for model building 
5.	Colab notebook

Scope of the project:
Prediction house prices are expected to help people who plan to buy a house so they can know the price range in the future, then they can plan their finance well. In addition, house price predictions are also beneficial for property investors to know the trend of housing prices in a certain location.

Outcomes:
1.  Successfully handled missing values, standardized numerical fields (e.g., total_sqft), and converted non-uniform data formats (such as range values) into usable numerical formats.
2.  Applied outlier detection techniques to filter unrealistic property records based on room size, price per square foot, and bathroom-to-bedroom ratios.
3.  Created new features, such as price_per_sqft, to enhance model predictability and performance.
4.  Grouped locations with sparse data to improve model stability and reduce dimensionality, resulting in cleaner, more reliable data for analysis.
5.  Analyzed property prices by location, property type, and size, identifying key trends and market variations.
6.  Visualized patterns in property values across popular locations to inform real estate investment insights.
7.  Built and evaluated multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree Regression, to predict property prices.
8.  Achieved highest accuracy with the Linear Regression model, scoring approximately 90% using cross-validation.
9.  Leveraged GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters across different algorithms, ensuring the best model was selected based on predictive accuracy.
10.  Implemented feature selection techniques to improve model interpretability and performance.
11.  Developed a predictive function to estimate property prices based on location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and bedrooms.
12.  Created scatter plots and histograms to visualize pricing distributions, ensuring clear communication of data insights.
